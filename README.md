# Rust Neural Network

Hello !! ! Guess what I just did! 

OH.

how did you know :)

MY BACKPROPAGATION ALGORITHM WORKS BABY. I spent so much time on this shit.

I'd like to thank Mr. Doyle for being a goated calculus teacher.

I also learned rust while doing this. Man. Rust is soooooo fast. The type system is a little annoying, but it's worth it at runtime, and I get garunteed type safety!? Can't beat that.
